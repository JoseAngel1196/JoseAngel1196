# 👋 Hey, I'm Jose Hidalgo

I’m a software engineer who loves building platforms and products that make developers (and users) happier 🙂.

### 🧠 My tech comfort zone

`Go` · `Python` · `Typescript` · `Kubernetes` · `Terraform` · `Prometheus` · `Kafka`

You don't see it? Just name it – I'm always happy to learn a new tool. You know what they say: it's not the language, but the problem.
